# Xplore: Developer Toolkit
A toolkit for every ServiceNow developer.

### Version 4.13
* Fixed snd_xplore_glasses script so it doesn't break in Studio or other applications.
* Glasses icon has been replaced with the code-edit icon for San Diego versions.
* Deprecated glasses support for UI15.
* Fixed an issue where the notification area in lower right corner prevents "Show" links from working on smaller screens.

### Version 4.12.1

* Tested on Rome and San Diego.
* Added a new setting to control the default editor width.
* Fixed a bug with scoped script execution not being aware of all config options.
* Added a new debug mode option for Xplore to help with tricky Java APIs. This is primarily for Xplore development, but will likely be useful to others.
* Added UI support for internal gs.debug, gs.warn, and gs.error logs.
* Added better support for displaying exceptions by preventing Java getMessage errors.
* Fixed a bug where duplicating tabs in Chrome would incorrectly turn all settings on.
* Added a hoisting notice that is displayed whenever hoisting is active (related to Chrome duplicate tab bug).

### Version 4.10 (Skipped)

### Version 4.9
* Added two new options to history items to open them in a new tab or share them via encoded URL.
Large links can be pasted directly into the script editor where they will be loaded automatically.

* General theming improvements.

### Version 4.8
* (beta) Added support for themes! The themes have been adapted from CodeMirror
  themes to with Xplore so some work better than others.
* Added script execution history. Each time you open Xplore, a new session is
  started and your script is saved when you run it. By default, 50 sessions
  are stored, but you can change this number using a system property. This is
  user specific.
* Settings from within Xplore are now able to be saved so they are loaded the next
  time Xplore is opened. This is user specific.
* Added automatic link recognition to Xplore output. Reference fields, links, and
  table.sys_id values are automatically converted to clickable links.
* Added support for function hoisting in the Editor. Note this is disabled by default but
  can be enabled from Xplore settings.
* Reorganised the main information window and about section and included release notes.
* Overhauled the Logs menu to include many more contextual links for logs generated
  during the last script execution, as well as shortcut links to logs just generated today.
* Added Select2 to Target and Scope selectors to make them easier to use.
* Improved the gs log behaviour to work as close to native as possible. gs.debug(), gs.info(),
  gs.warn() and gs.error() can now take 6 arguments while gs.log() will take 2 and gs.print() just 1.
* Fixed a bug where opening a list with an encoded query containing single quotes would
  not work because it was not properly escaped.
* Minor improvements to Xplore processor.
* Changed blacklist to ignorelist and redlist to warnlist.
